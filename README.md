Kickstarter Campaign
## Overview of Project 
Louise, a play writer needs help for crowdfunding her next play.She has a estimated budget of $10,000,We will be analyzing crowdfunding data to determine whether there are specific factors that make a project's campaign successful.
### Purpose
Through different factors we will analyse whether the crowdfunding campaign will be successful or not.And this will help Louise in finding main factors that could effect the on running campaigns.
## Analysis and Challenges
Louise just have predictive data on hand and, it is a very generalized research she is looking into.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

Two conclusions that can be drawn about the outcomes based on launch date are:
1. The Mid summer has the highest outcomes (May,June & July), we see rise in the demand for theater!

2. During the fall we see rise in the number of failed plays;however, very few were canceled in both seasons.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

Outcomes based on goals shows that  Successful campaigns are a reflection, opposite of Failed campaigns.
This could be due to generalization of the data set provided. 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
This data set limits our findings, as we don't know which country we are talking about, as not only time but locations also matter.
Also, This dataset is generalized, if we specific information we can elaborate more on findings.

## Results.
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
1.We can do outcomes based on goals vs pledged amounts for each country
2.We can filter for other subcategories and not just plays and find which subcategory in theaters is more common.
3.We can do column charts based on different outcomes in different countries.
